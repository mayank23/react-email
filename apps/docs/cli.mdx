## `email dev`

Starts a local development server that will watch your files and automatically rebuild your email when you make changes.

### Where can I place my static files for previewing

Almost always you will need to have static files in your emails, and seeing
them on the preview server without having to first host on a CDN is very helpful.

We do allow for this, and currently, you can place your files inside of a `static` 
directory inside of your `emails` directory. 

This does adjust to your `--dir` option, so if your `emails` directory was inside
of `./src/emails`, you would place your static files inside of `./src/emails/static`.

These static files are directly served from our preview server by looking into the
requests made into that end with `/static` and serving the files at that point,
this also allows for you to have images inside of your emails like so:

```jsx
export default Email(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      <img src="/static/email-logo.png" />
    </div>
  )
}
```

### How to make the preview server ignore directories

Once the preview server has started and is now open on `localhost`, the preview server
reads recursively down into all of your files and directories. This can be disabled
from a directory down by prefixing it with `_`, e.g. `components -> _components`. So if you wanted
to make components for your emails, you could make a structure as follows:

```bash
my-project
├── emails
│   ├── _components
│   │   └── this-is-not-going-to-appear-in-the-sidebar.tsx
│   ├── email.tsx
│   └── static
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

### The heuristics for files to be considered emails

To avoid uncanny files appearing in the sidebar of the preview server,
we account for two heuristics to determine weather or not we should
include it:

1. If file has `.js, .jsx or .tsx` file extensions
2. If the file contains a `export default` expression by matching with the regex <br/>
`/\bexport\s*default\b/gm`

These can certainly fail as they are only heuristics, so if you do find
any issues with these, feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/resend/react-email/issues).
